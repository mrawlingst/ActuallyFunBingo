For the Regenerate Magicka enchant milestone

BigDickDps - Yesterday at 6:40 PM
@Dylan I'll need to let you win lol. I can't play any longer I have to go out and buy stuff for dog, then wakl it, then workout.  GG my dude and I think we need to tune down some of the stuff. Also, yeah it should count
Dylan - Yesterday at 6:40 PM

I think even mike stopped watching
:LUL:
Dylan - Yesterday at 6:42 PM
doing it on master definitely requires some sketchy skipping and sprinting
because no way you'll be able to level up quickly enough to match the difficulty(edited)
And I should have gone to Riften for silver necklace
BigDickDps - Yesterday at 6:43 PM
Yeah. That's how i completed nightingale. took me a whole hour. I was going to do the level up glitch to level myself to 99 but idk if there is enemy scaling but I was gonna do it to completet he last line for perk lol
Dylan - Yesterday at 6:43 PM
didn't know I could steal
lol
there's a level glitch? >_>
BigDickDps - Yesterday at 6:43 PM
alot of gen shops have it
i went to riften cause there was 4 quest related there
Dylan - Yesterday at 6:43 PM
oh
BigDickDps - Yesterday at 6:44 PM
nightingale, the bow, the necklace and nir / ghostblade were hella close
Dylan - Yesterday at 6:44 PM
I mostly focused on things that didn't require me to do a quest
BigDickDps - Yesterday at 6:44 PM
yeah i should of did that
and yeah there is a level glitch
there are a few actually
can level one hand to 99, or sneak to 99 and that will get you alot of levels early on
Dylan - Yesterday at 6:46 PM
oic
99 sneak would've helped with a lot of things lol
BigDickDps - Yesterday at 6:46 PM
ikr
esp with the invisble shout
if that's not a mod..
I think
Dylan - Yesterday at 6:47 PM
There's one yeah

BigDickDps - Yesterday at 6:47 PM
