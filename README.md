# ActuallyFunBingo

*Originally inspired by [OOT Bingo](http://speedruntools.com/bingo/oot)*.

A standalone application for bingo for games.

First made a [web version](https://mrawlingst.github.io/wow-bingo/) of bingo for World of Warcraft before I decided to do a standalone application and support for other games.

## Features
Planned Features:
* Timer
    * Record your time to complete the bingo for comparison with your friends
    * Automatically stops when you *bingo*; completed row/column/diagonal/etc
* Randomly generated card
    * Supports seeding system
* Curatation system
    * Make mutually exclusive milestones not share same row/col/diagonal
* Support different games
    * Allow users to create their own list of milestones for different games
* Modes for Bingo

## Games
Planned Official Game Support:
* Dark Souls
* Dark Souls II
* Dark Souls III
* Super Mario 64
* The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
* The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
* World of Warcraft

## Modes
Planned Bingo Modes:
* Standard
    * Standard rules for bingo applies here
* Lockout
    * Players share same card and players can claim milestones for themselves
    * Left clicking a milestone will color the milestone and show it to other player
    * Right clicking a milestone will star and doesn't show it to other player
        * Useful for planning ahead
* Blackout
    * A bingo where you must fill in all 25 milestones before the timer stops

## TODO
* Implement planned games
* Support networked shared bingo for lockout bingo
